# divine
The tiny file splitter and joiner written in C++. One of my first projects from 2009.

# How to build
The build system used for this project is CMake. To build the project in GNU/Linux, simply do the following:
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake ../
By executing the above commands, the build process happens in the ./build directory. The resulting executable is a test program.

# Using as a library
Divine is written as a small header-only library. To use it in other projects, simply including the header does the job.
